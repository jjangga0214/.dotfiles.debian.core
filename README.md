# .dotfiles.debian.core

## :warning: CAUTION

Read [CAUTION.md](CAUTION.md) before any execution here.

## project convention

* Most directories have **README.md**. Please refer them to get detail.
* If one can easily grasp role and effect of a certain script by just looking it, detail description is omitted in README.md. 
* Most scripts and README.md do not care about specific upper level use. To know how a script is used(from 'client-side') in overall, one need to look at decription on higher level modules, which are close to project root.

## clone and placement

This project is designed to be a library(generally git submodule) for other .dotfiles project. However, this can also be used directly as .dotfiles of system. In that case, exeuctes the below. 

```bash
sudo apt install git && \
git clone https://github.com/jjangga0214/.dotfiles.debian.core.git $HOME/.dotfiles && \
cd $HOME/.dotfiles && git submodule update
```

I prefer to place .dotfiles project under `$HOME` with name of **.dotfiles**. I even set `alias dot=cd ~/.dotfiles` on [jjangga0214/.dotfiles.oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/jjangga0214/.dotfiles.oh-my-zsh) which is used as [git submodule](.gitmodules) in this project as name of [.dotfiles.oh-my-zsh](.dotfiles.oh-my-zsh). 

## automatic installation and configuration

Basically, this project is to automatically set preferable environment with ease. [install.sh](install.sh) is for that automation. This handles apt, snap, zsh, oh-my-zsh, node, nvm, go and so on. Also, it clones [jjangga0214/note](https://github.com/jjangga0214/note) to `$HOME`**/note**.

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

## maunal installation and configuration

### env

#### zsh and oh-my-zsh

zsh and oh-my-zsh would be installed and configured automatically. However, following config is recommended to do manually.

##### default shell

Config zsh as default shell instead of bash. The change would be applied after rebooting.

```bash
sudo -s
chsh -s $(which zsh)
chsh -s $(which zsh) $(whoami)
```

##### spelling check

Enable spelling check by executing the following on zsh.

```zsh
setopt correct
```

##### keep this project in sync

For understanding mantainence strategy, please read [this](oh-my-zsh/README.md#maintenance-of-zsh-and-oh-my-zsh). [oh-my-zsh.sync.sh](oh-my-zsh.sync.sh) exactly does that.

```bash
zsh oh-my-zsh.sync.sh
```

For setting gpg signiture on git commit, refer [here](https://gist.github.com/ankurk91/c4f0e23d76ef868b139f3c28bde057fc). Note that it's of course totally optional and might make some git tools such as gitkraken disable to commit.
